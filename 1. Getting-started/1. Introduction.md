## Introduction:

- Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software. Originally developed as the Hudson project, Jenkins is written in Java and provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project.

- Jenkins helps automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) as its two main pillars.

- **CI-CD:** This practice allows development teams to frequently deliver and deploy applications and accelerate the application development process.
  
- **CI:** continuous integration is the build stage of the software release, where developers merge their changes in the main repository of the GitHub.
  
- **CD:** Continuous delivery picks up where continuous integration ends. CD automates the continuous deployment.

- **Jenkins master:** where Jenkins installed. Primary server of the Jenkins. Master Jenkins is capable of directly executing build jobs.
This is the main Jenkins server responsible for managing and executing tasks. It handles scheduling build jobs, monitoring nodes (agents/slaves), and distributing tasks to these nodes.

- **Jenkins Slave:** Its run on the remote server. The Jenkins slave follows the request of the Jenkins master and compatible with all the OS.
Building jobs dispatched by the master are executed by the slave.
