## Jenkins Slave agent:

- The concept of a slave agent allows Jenkins to distribute its workload across multiple machines, enabling parallel and distributed builds.
  
- In Jenkins, the concept of "slave agents" (also known as build agents or nodes) is essential to distribute and parallelize build tasks across multiple machines. While the master node handles the Jenkins server's management and coordination, slave nodes allow for the concurrent execution of builds on different machines.

- Continuous build availability: If the master node becomes unavailable, builds can still be executed on slave agents.

-  You can configure different slave agents to specialize in particular tasks, such as building, testing, or deploying.

- Slave agents can run on machines with different operating systems or architectures. To handle a large number of builds concurrently and reduce build time.
