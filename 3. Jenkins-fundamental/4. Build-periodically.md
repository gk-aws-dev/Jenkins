## Build periodically:

- In Jenkins, the```Build periodically``` option allows you to schedule your Jenkins job to run at specific intervals, similar to how you might schedule tasks on a cron job in Unix-based systems.
 
- When configuring a Jenkins job, you can enable the "Build periodically" option and specify a schedule using cron syntax. Cron syntax consists of five fields representing minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week, respectively. Here's a breakdown:

- ```Go to job – configure – build trigger – build periodically – mention the time there with * - apply and save.```

```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └── Day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday; 7 is also Sunday)
│ │ │ └──── Month (1 - 12)
│ │ └────── Day of the month (1 - 31)
│ └──────── Hour (0 - 23)
└────────── Minute (0 - 59)
```

- some examples are below for the crontab
```
•	0 * * * *: Run the task at the beginning of every hour.
•	*/15 * * * *: Run the task every 15 minutes.
•	0 2 * * *: Run the task daily at 2:00 AM.
•	0 0 * * 5: Run the task at midnight every Friday.
•	30 3 1 * *: Run the task at 3:30 AM on the 1st day of every month.
```
