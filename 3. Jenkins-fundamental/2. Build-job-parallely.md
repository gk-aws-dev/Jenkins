## Building Job parallelly: 

- we need to create first job1, job2 and job2 for this.

- Go to job1 configuration – build steps – post build action – build other projects – mention job there (job2, job3) – trigger only if the build is stable – apply and save.
- Once you build the job1, you can see all are executed at same time.

- like below image we have to define the JOB there to execute it parrallely.
