## Webhooks:

- The primary use of webhooks is to notify external services or systems about events that occur in another system. Here are some common use cases for webhooks.

- ***GitHub webhooks notify Jenkins about events, such as code pushes, pull requests, or repository updates, triggering Jenkins jobs to build, test, and deploy code.***

- When Jenkins receives a webhook payload from the repository, it triggers a build of the associated Jenkins job, allowing you to automate your continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) workflows
  more efficiently. This real-time triggering of builds helps reduce the delay between code changes and feedback

## How to configure the webhooks in the Jenkins:

```
Go to github repo – go to repo setting – webhooks – add webhooks – payload url (copy Jenkins url here: http://107.22.38.26:8080/jenkins/github-webhook/) – content type – application json – which event – push event – add webhook.
Go to Jenkins – name – item name – freestyle project – SCM – git – paste git repo url – build trigger - GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling – apply save.
```
