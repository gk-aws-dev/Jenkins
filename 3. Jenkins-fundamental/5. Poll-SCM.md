## Poll SCM:
- In Jenkins, ```Poll SCM``` is a feature that allows you to periodically check your source code repository for changes and trigger a build if new changes are detected. SCM stands for Source Code Management.

- this is related to git; it is like build periodically.

- ***in git repo if any new changes, then only job will build. if no changes in git, then skip the build.***

- Make job for the poll-scm.

```
Configure – discard old builds – SCM – git – copy git repo url here – branch to build, by default its /master – build triggers – poll SCM – give cron schedule here – build env – delete the build before starts – 
build steps – apply and save.
```

- By default the build will triggers first time only, but next time it will trigger when we making any changes in our GitHub repo as per our given schedule in poll scm.
