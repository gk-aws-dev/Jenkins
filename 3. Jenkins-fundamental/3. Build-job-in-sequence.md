## Build job in sequence: build job1, job2 and job3 in sequence.

- Go to job1 – configure – post build action – build other projects - mention job2 – trigger if only build is stable – apply and save.

- Likewise go to the job2 – and mention the job 3 there.(follow above steps)

- You can see the upstream and downstream projects, upstream means it will execute before and downstream means it will execute later.
- Now just build ```job1``` and then it will build the ```job2``` and ```job3``` in sequence.
