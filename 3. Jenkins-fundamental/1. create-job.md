## Jenkins-Job:

- A Jenkins job is a configuration that defines a specific task or set of tasks to be executed by Jenkins. These tasks can include compiling code, running tests, deploying applications, and executing other custom scripts or commands.

- we can use the jenkins job for the small task or repetetive task, that no need to do with the pipeline.

## Create job for the Git clone with shell

- create the job for the git clone:

- Create new job: click on new item – item name – freestyle project – ok (job created) - Click on the created job – description – discard old build – build steps – execute shell - apply - save.
```
yum install git -y
git clone https://github.com/gk-aws-dev/game-of-life.git   (you can use your repo here)
```

- Click on build now. Below you can see your GitHub repository: root/.jenkins/workspace/git-clone-with-shell/game-of-life

- once we click on ‘build now’ then it will through an error message as ‘already exists and is not an empty directory’
- To avoid above error, we must change below setting in the configuration of the build: configure – build environment – delete the workspace before build starts.
