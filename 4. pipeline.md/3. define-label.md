- we can mention label in our pipeline. with help of the label we are mentioning the agent on which the pipeline will run.

- In Jenkins pipelines, the ```label``` keyword is used to specify which agent (or node) should be used to execute the pipeline or a specific stage of the pipeline. This is particularly useful in environments where there are 
  multiple Jenkins agents (nodes) with different capabilities or responsibilities.

```
pipeline {
	agent {
			label 'linux'
	}
	stages {
		stage ("Stage-1"){
			steps {
			    echo "Hello World"
			}
		}
		stage ("Stage-2"){
			steps {
			    echo "Hello World two"
			}
		}
		stage ("Stage-3"){
			steps {
			    echo "Hello World three"
			}
		}
	}
}
```


```
pipeline {
	agent{
		label{
			label "built-in"
			customWorkspace "/data/pipeline"
		}
	}

	stages {
		stage ("on master"){
				steps {
					sh "yum install tree -y"
				}
		}
		stage ("on slave"){
				agent {
					label "linux"
					customWorkspace "/home/ec2-user"
				}
				steps {
					sh "sudo yum install tree -y"
				}
		}
	}
}
```
