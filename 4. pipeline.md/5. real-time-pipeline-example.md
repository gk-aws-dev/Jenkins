- below is the real time example of the pipeline which is used to deploy the application on the tomcat.
- in ```clone``` stage it will clone the git repo
- in ```maven``` stage it will build the war file in the mentioned path/directory.
- in ```deploy``` stage it will deploy the war file in tomcat

- (pre-requisite - you have to install the tomcat and need to up and running the tomcat)



```
pipeline {
    	agent {
        	label {
        		label "built-in"
        		customWorkspace "/data"
        	}
    	}
    	stages {
        	stage ("clone") {
            			steps {
                			sh "git clone https://github.com/awsdevops77/maven-project.git"  // you can use your repo here
            			}
        	}
        	stage ("maven") {
            			steps {
					dir ("/data/maven-project") {                                     // you can give the your desired path here.
					                        	sh "rm -rf /root/.m2/repository"
              								sh "mvn clean package"
           	 			}
        			}
        	}		
        	stage ("deploy") {
            			steps {
					dir ("/data/maven-project/webapp/target") {                                       // here it will copy the file, to webapps directory.
                			sh "cp -r webapp.war /data/tools/apache-tomcat-9.0.84/webapps"        
                   		}
				}
        	}
    	}
}
```
