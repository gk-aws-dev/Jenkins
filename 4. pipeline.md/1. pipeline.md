## Pipeline:

- A pipeline in Jenkins is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines.

- A Jenkins pipeline allows you to define an entire software delivery process as code, which is known as "Pipeline as Code".

- This means you can describe your build, test, and deploy processes in a Jenkinsfile, a simple text file that Jenkins understands.


## concepts of the pipeline:

1. Jenkinsfile:

- A text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins pipeline and is typically checked into source control/github.
- Can be written using a declarative syntax or a scripted syntax.

2. Declarative Pipeline:

- A newer, more user-friendly way to define pipelines.
- Uses a simpler syntax and provides richer features for defining the pipeline. we can easily understand and write the pipeline in simple ways.
  
3. Scripted Pipeline:

- Uses Groovy language for defining pipelines.
- Provides more flexibility and control but can be more complex.

  - below is the example of the pipeline:
 
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add build steps here, e.g., compile the code, run build tools
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add test steps here, e.g., run unit tests
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add deploy steps here, e.g., deploy to staging/production
            }
        }
    }

```
