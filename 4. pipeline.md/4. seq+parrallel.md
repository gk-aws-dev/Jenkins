- we can defibne the sequencial stages and parrallel stages as well in the pipeline.
- here once stage1 will execute and after that stages under stage2 will execute parrallely.

```
pipeline {
	agent {
			label 'built-in'
	}
	stages {
		stage ('stage-1'){
				steps {
					echo "Hello World"
				}
		}
		stage ('parallel-stages-2'){
					parallel {
						stage ('sleep-1'){
								steps {
									sleep 10
								}
						}
						stage ('sleep-2'){
								steps {
									sleep 10
								}
						}
					}
		}
		stage ('stage-3'){
				steps {
					echo "Hello World"
				}
		}
	}
}
```
